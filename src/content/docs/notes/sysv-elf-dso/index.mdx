The notes here are based on my understanding and reading of the System V ABI document. These are neither
complete nor beginner friendly. The purpose of these notes is to provide a quick reference.

You can find the table of contents for the notes on the left sidebar if you are using a wide screen. On
mobile, you can click the menu icon on the top right corner.
