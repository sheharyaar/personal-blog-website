This series of articles contains my notes on Linux Containers where I explore container **primitives** -- **capabilities**, **namespaces** and **cgroups** in detail at both userspace and kernel level. 

I have also implemented a simple low-level container runtime. Notes on implementation are available in the [last article](../linux-containers/04-project).
