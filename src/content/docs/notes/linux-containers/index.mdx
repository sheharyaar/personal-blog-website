<Aside type='caution'>This is a work in progress, parts of some notes are left as **TODOs**. I will complete them soon!</Aside>

This series of articles contains my notes on Linux Containers where I explore container **primitives** -- **capabilities**, **namespaces** and **cgroups** in detail at both userspace and kernel level. 

I have also implemented a simple low-level container runtime. Notes on implementation are available in the [last article](../linux-containers/04-project).
