## Prerequisites

- To get started we need to be through the basics of [Linux Kernel Namespaces](../linux-containers/01-namespaces) and [Linux cgroups](../linux-containers/02-cgroups).
- Follow the blog series by Hechao Li : [Mini Container Series Part 0](https://hechao.li/posts/Mini-Container-Series-Part-0-Not-a-Real-Container/)
- Reference Code : [container-runtime](https://github.com/sheharyaar/container-runtime)

### User NS, Privileges and UID/GID mappings

If we use clone using the flags `CLONE_NEWUSER`, it creates a new user namespace. the execed process spawns with UID 0 in then 
new namespace, but what is it's UID in the parent namespace? If the child process creates a file in the shared filesystem, what will 
be the UID and GID of the file ? This is done by using `UID mappings` and `GID mappings`.

- The file `/proc/PID/uid_map` (PID of child in parent ns) determines the mapping of UID of the child process ftom the `host` to the `container`.
- Similary the file `/proc/PID/gid_map` determines the mapping of GID of the child process.
- By default, the file is empty with no entries, in those cases UID mentioned in `/proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid` and GID mentioned in `/proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid` is used 
in the host for the child process (the child has UID 0 in it's own namespace). So if the child creates a file in the shared namespace, 
it will have UID and GID as `65534` (value of overflowuid in my kernel) in the parent namespace.

For more information on UID and GID mappings, and the format of mappings, see [user_namespaces(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html).
We can perform the mapping after the clone, using the following code : 

```c
static int update_map(char *path, char *buf, size_t size) {
	int fd = open(path, O_WRONLY | O_CLOEXEC);
	if (fd == -1) {
		pr_err("error in opening file (%s): %s\n", path, strerror(errno));
		return -1;
	}

	if (write(fd, buf, size) < 0) {
		pr_err("error in writing to file (%s): %s\n", path, strerror(errno));
		close(fd);
		return -1;
	}

	close(fd);
	return 0;
}

int setup_uid_gid_map(int child_pid)
{
	// open the uid_map file and write the string
	// we will use hardcoded value from /proc/$$/uid_map
	// this will map users starting from 0 to (0 + 4294967295) from the host
	// and 0 to (0 + 4294967295) in the container. 
	// So 0 in host is 0 in container (hence privileged)
	char uid_map_path[256];
	char gid_map_path[256];
	char *map_buf = "0 0 4294967295";

	snprintf(uid_map_path, 255, "/proc/%d/uid_map", child_pid);
	snprintf(gid_map_path, 255, "/proc/%d/gid_map", child_pid);

	if (update_map(uid_map_path, map_buf, strlen(map_buf)) < 0) return -1;
	if (update_map(gid_map_path, map_buf, strlen(map_buf)) < 0) return -1;
	return 0;
}
```

### Network setup

<Aside type="note"> This section will be done after I gain deeper understanding and experience of `rtnetlink` and `netlink` in general and their effect under namespaces.</Aside>

### Setting up the file-system

There are multiple steps involved in setting the file-system of a container. It is suggested to use `pivot_root` as a stronger mechanism to prevent `chroot` jail escape.
The conditions for a successfult pivot_root are :
- The `old_root` and the `new_root` should be a mount point (can be enforced using `MS_BIND` to self).
- For child namespaces, the rootfs (`/`) should be mount as `MS_PRIVATE` or `MS_SLAVE` to prevent changes
the child namespace propagate to the parent namespace

The steps involved in pivot_root are :
- Mount `/` as `MS_PRIVATE | MS_REC`.
- Bind mount the new rootfs using `MS_BIND` 
- Open `/` and the `new_root` as passed by the user and get their file-descriptors.
- Change the directory to the new root **fd** using `fchdir`.
- Then we perform the pivot_root using a special case (which allows us to do this without creating a directory in the new_root).
- Mount the `procfs` **before** we unmount the oldroot, otherwise we get `EPERM` error on mounting procfs.
- Then we go back to the old root (`fchdir`), and then unmount the old root. Here is the code without error-handling. You can also mount the **proc** file-system if you need.

```c
// mount the current fs as MS_PRIVATE to prevent child mounts from propagating
mount(NULL, "/", NULL, MS_REC | MS_PRIVATE, NULL);
// ensure the new root mount point is a mount point, by doing a MS_BIND mount
mount(ctx->rootfs, ctx->rootfs, NULL, MS_BIND, NULL);

// get handles for oldroot and newroot
int oldroot = open("/", O_DIRECTORY | O_RDONLY, 0);
int newroot = open(ctx->rootfs, O_DIRECTORY | O_RDONLY, 0);

// change directory to the new root to perform pivot
fchdir(newroot);

// perform pivot root
syscall(SYS_pivot_root, ".", ".");

// mount the procfs before we unmount the oldroot
mount("proc", "/proc", "proc", MS_NOSUID|MS_NOEXEC|MS_NODEV, NULL);

// go back to oldroot. Why ?? : we need to unmount the oldroot
fchdir(oldroot);

// unmount the old one
umount2(".", MNT_DETACH);

// go to the new root
chdir("/");
```

### Namespace and cgroup setup

#### Namespaces

- To setup the namespace, you can either use `unshare` in the child process, or `clone` in the parent process. I avoided `unshare` to avoid closing the inherited file descriptors and other cleanups. I expected `clone` to be clean.
- For clone you can just call it using the flags. I used the raw syscall, since the `glibc` wrapper requires a starting function for the child.

```c
int flags = CLONE_NEWNS | CLONE_NEWPID | CLONE_NEWUTS | CLONE_NEWIPC
        | CLONE_NEWNET;
        
pid = syscall(SYS_clone, SIGCHLD | ctx->flags, 0, NULL, NULL, 0);
if (pid == -1) {
	/* error */
} else if (pid == 0) {
	/* child */
	setup_rootfs();
	exec();
} else {
	/* parent */
}
```

#### Cgroup

There are two ways to add a new process to a cgroup:
1. `echo` the PID of the child process to `cgroup.procs` file.

- This has a few drawbacks, such as the child PID should be known beforehand, so this must be called after the child process is created. 
- To do this before execing the program in the child process, there must be synchronisation mechanism between the parent and the child process. The parent process moves the child to the cgroup and then signals the child process.
- Synchronisation with child is difficult in cases when the child is cloned with flags like `CLONE_NEWNS`, `CLONE_NEWIPC` and without `CLONE_VM`, the memory region of the child is not shared with the parent. So synchronisation methods like `message queues`, `semaphores`, `shared memory` do not work well (as far as I exprerimented, I could be wrong about this!).

2. using the `CLONE_INTO_CGROUP` to `clone3` syscall.

- This method does not require any synchronisation methods or creating the child process beforehand. The kernel creates the child process directly into the cgroup. However, this method requries the support of `clone3` and the `CLONE_INTO_CGROUP` flag in the kernel.
- The `clone3` calls takes in `struct clone_args` structure as one of the parameter. The cgroup folder must be created and after setting the appropriate limits, a file descriptor to the cgroup folder is set in the `crgroup` field of `clone_args`.

```c
struct clone_args args = {0};
args.flags = ctx->flags;	// flags such as CLONE_NEWNS, etc.
args.cgroup = ctx->cgroup_fd;
args.exit_signal = SIGCHLD;

int pid = syscall(SYS_clone3, &args, sizeof(struct clone_args));
```

### Extras

There are many more features that can be implemented in a container runtime such as â€” 

- Console or TTY setup
- Setting capabilities for the container processes
- SELinux policies
- AppArmor profiles
- Checkpoint and Restore
- Core scheduling domain ([https://lwn.net/Articles/876707/](https://lwn.net/Articles/876707/))
- I/O Priority

For implementation and reference of these features, you can refer to [LXC](https://github.com/lxc/lxc) or [runC](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/) implementations.

Also, I wrote an interesting [blog on synchronisation](../../../blog/container-process-sync/) mechanism between parent and child process during namespace isolation. 
You can read it, if you are interested.
