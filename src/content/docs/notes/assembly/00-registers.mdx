## Registers

- `8` registers with names and `8` registers with numbers:
```asm
rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, rsp, rbp
r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15
```
- **Prefixes**
  - `r` prefix is for 64-bit
  - `e` is for 32-bit (eax, ebx, exc, etc.)
  - no prefix is used for 16-bit or 2 byte- registers (ax, bx, cx, etc.)
  - `h` and `l` suffix is used for 8-bits, where `h` is for higher 8-bit and `l` is for lower 8-bit.

### Caller and Callee Saved

Caller saved (or must be preserved by the caller — the caller can expect the values to be changed after a
function or system call). These are also called as `call-clobbered` registers.

```asm
rax, rcx, rdx, r8-r11
```

Callee saved (the function must store and restore these registers, the caller can expect them to be unchanged)

```asm
rbx, rbp, rdi, rsi, rsp, r12-r15
```

## Debug Registers

There are certain registers that can be used to create exceptions and for debugging purposes. These are discussed in the [Debugging](#) page.
