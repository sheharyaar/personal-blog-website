This is a collection of my notes on Computer Science topics that I like to explore. I enjoy studying the
internal workings of technologies.

<Aside type="caution">
    The notes are based on _my_ understanding of the topics. If you find any issues or incorrect information,
    please ping me at my email ([sheharyaar48@gmail.com](mailto:sheharyaar48@gmail.com))
